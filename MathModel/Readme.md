This script contains the Matlab code (Bcell_ODE_fit.m) to implement the mathematical modeling on the B-cell population dynamics. 

It fitted the birth-death ODE to the cell percent measurements and inferred the differentiation rates.

It was written in the Windows. Mac users may need to adjust the format of the folder path.

Expt_Data_for_Model_Fitting.xlsx contains the cell counts and percentages as well as input net proliferation rates.

The results files provide the output from running the code, the inferred differentiation rates.  Each xlsx file is a different input parameter scenario and contains results for either IkBKO vs Wildtype (KOvWT) or Aged Wildtype vs Young Wildtype (OldvsYoung).
